Tk::LayerEditor Module

Tk::LayerEditor is a widget similar to the layer dialog in The Gimp or
Photoshop. It can be used to drag layers up and down and to turn
visibility on and off. See examples/bbbike.pl for an example for this
widget (requires Tk 800.016)

This widget comes in two flavours: the Tk::LayerEditor is a plain
widget derived from a frame, which can be embedded in own mainwindows
or toplevels. The Tk::LayerEditorToplevel is a toplevel widget with
optional buttons.

There is no real POD yet, but hopefully in a future version.

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
