Tk::LayerEditor Module

Tk::LayerEditor is a widget similar to the layer dialog in The Gimp or
Photoshop. It can be used to drag layers up and down and to turn
visibility on and off. See examples/bbbike.pl for an example for this
widget (requires Tk 800.016)

There is no real POD yet, but hopefully in a future version.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

The bbbike.pl test script can be invoked before installing with

        $ perl -Mblib examples/bbbike.pl
